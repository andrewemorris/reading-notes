## What is a growth mindset?
A **growth mindset** is a open approach to learning that starts from the perspective that skills and knowledge are not fixed or ossified and can be developed and grow

Three things to keep oneself on-track with a *growth mindset*:
- 	🤡  Mistakes are a learning opportunity
- 	🤗 The success of others is something to spur oneself onwards
-   🤯 The mind is like plastic not stone
