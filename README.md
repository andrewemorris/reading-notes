## What is a growth mindset?
A **growth mindset** is a open approach to learning that starts from the perspective that skills and knowledge are not fixed or ossified and can be developed and grow

Three things to keep oneself on-track with a *growth mindset*:
- 	:clown_face: Mistakes are a learning opportunity
- 	:hugs: The success of others is something to spur oneself onwards
- :exploding_head: The mind is like plastic not stone
