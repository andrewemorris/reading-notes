# Git & GitHub

## Git vs. GitHub

* Git is the private local version control repository
* GitHub is the remote shared public version control repository

## Cloning

To make a local copy of a remote repo use `clone` with the URL of the git, e.g. `git clone https://github.com/andrewemorris/reading-notes.git`

## The Process

The Git/GitHub process is:

1. Add (locally to git)
2. Commit (the local changes)
3. Push (the commited changes to the remote GitHub)
