# Why this topic matters
Markdown is a ubiquitous method of quickly documenting repos and sharing text

## Summary of this task
The task is to go through a collection of resources about a topic from a lecture and create a summary of the material in a format that could be easily understood by a non-technical friend. The summary should be added to a reading-notes repository and could take the form of a blog article with code samples, a dictionary or flash cards, notes in outline form, a fill-in-the-blank worksheet, or a resource such as a guide to Markdown basic syntax or mastering Markdown on GitHub. Additionally, the task may also include watching a video on GitHub Pages and bookmarking the GitHub Markdown Syntax resource.
